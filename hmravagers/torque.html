<p><strong>Differences from Storymode</strong></p>
<p>The most punishing difference from Storymode is that the amount of DPS required to kill the boss is much higher, which not only lengthens the fight and forces the raid to use the consoles to spawn repair droids, but also requires good execution across the board. Not only do the boss and the Flame Turret/Shoot Lasers have more health, but there are a new set of adds called Tamper Deterrent Devices which deal a large amount of damage and require some AOE DPS since there are four on each side. However, the raid must be especially careful not to clip repair droids with AOE while killing these adds.</p>

<h5><span id="WOOKIEE_RAGE">WOOKIEE RAGE</span></h5>
<p>Torque casts this every 45s starting 45s into the fight, and continuing until the end of the fight. This attack does a small amount of damage and issues a raid-wide knockback which can be resisted by moves like Hold the Line/Hydraulic Overrides and Hunker Down/Entrench. When the cast finishes, Torque jumps to the closest unbroken console and destroys it, then resumes his normal attacks.</p>
<h5><span id="Repair_Droid">Repair Droid</span></h5>
<p><a href="/images/37e1fe27ba30b477a242ac1c13b6d37d.png"><img style="margin: 5px; border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;" title="" src="/images/37e1fe27ba30b477a242ac1c13b6d37d.png" alt="" width="240" height="157" border="0"></a></p>
<p>These are used to counteract the broken console from WOOKIEE RAGE. If 3 consoles are destroyed at any time, the raid instantly wipes. You can spawn repair droids using the two buttons near the front of the room to fix broken consoles and avoid this fate (see picture). Notice each side has a button with icons next to it. These show how many droids you have remaining on each side (you start with 4 on each side, so there are 8 in total to use). It doesn’t matter which side you spawn droids from. Since the fight lasts about five and a half minutes, and WOOKIEE RAGE destroys consoles every 45s, you only have one or two spare repair droids, so be careful.</p>
<h5><span id="Dangerous_Fire_DeviceShoots_Lasers">Dangerous Fire Device/Shoots Lasers</span></h5>
<p><a href="/images/16d61004850f0410065d3d4ce4b6a169.png"><img style="margin: 5px; border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;" title="" src="/images/16d61004850f0410065d3d4ce4b6a169.png" alt="" width="240" height="157" border="0"></a><br>

<p>These adds are spawned by Torque in sequence and spawn right next to the boss. Shoot Lasers will spawn every 25 to 30 seconds, and Dangerous Fire Devices will spawn every 30 to 35 seconds. Shoot Lasers deal a moderate amount of damage to anyone in the path of their AoE and target repair droids aggressively. Dangerous Fire Devices only deal damage to anyone within 4m, but tick for an extremely large amount (20k+).</p>
<h5><span id="Tamper_Deterrent_Device">Tamper Deterrent Device</span></h5>
<p><a href="/images/eafc14ac2c1ff5127e07073fedaf204d.png"><img style="margin: 5px; border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;" title="" src="/images/eafc14ac2c1ff5127e07073fedaf204d.png" alt="" width="240" height="157" border="0"></a></p>
<p>Four Tamper Deterrent Devices spawn on both sides of the room every minute. They have a moderate amount of health so it is preferrable to AoE them down alongside Torque and the other adds.</p>
<h5><span id="Floor_Vents">Floor Vents</span></h5>
<p><a href="/images/c6a70f909d242d906a99fcc30541a014.png"><img style="margin: 5px; border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;" title="" src="/images/c6a70f909d242d906a99fcc30541a014.png" alt="" width="240" height="157" border="0"></a></p>
<p>All players must deal with the Floor Vents, which spawn on several members of the raid group every 30 seconds. Ticks of Floor Vents deal a very large amount of damage to non-tanks, and even for tanks constitute a real source of danger. You should move out of the Floor Vents immediately in order to avoid taking extra ticks. Generally 3 ticks of Floor Vents will kill anyone in the raid. If you have good timing and move at the time the Vents spawn, you can avoid taking any damage whatsoever.</p>
<h5><span id="Magnetic_Clamp">Magnetic Clamp</span></h5>
<p><a href="/images/4f8caabc6162a76356e89c708526c865.png"><img style="margin: 5px; border: 0px currentcolor; display: inline; background-image: none;" title="" src="/images/4f8caabc6162a76356e89c708526c865.png" alt="" width="240" height="157" border="0"></a></p>
<p>Magnetic Clamp is a DoT applied on 1-2 random raid members every 30s. The players with the DoT are stunned and must either be cleansed or use their CC break. This DoT deals a very large amount of damage and will usually kill a player in 3-4 GCDs.</p>
<h5><span id="Sick_Of_You">Sick Of You!</span></h5>
<p>This is a moderate strength attack that applies a debuff to the target with primary aggro (main tank). This forces a tank swap since that target takes double damage and will no longer be able to hold Torque without cooldowns.</p>
<h4><span id="Strategy">Strategy</span></h4>
<div style="background: #c54869; width: 100%; height: 2px;"></div>
<h5><span id="Pre-fight">Pre-fight</span></h5>
<ul>
<li>Assign a prearranged clicking order to spawn repair droids. If you assign four people to do it, that will be sufficient so that by the fifth click, the first person in the order will no longer have the debuff and can click again. The other raid members may serve as backups in case another click is needed or a raid member is unable to click for some reason.</li>
<li>Position most of the raid loosely near the door side of the room. Spreading the raid out through the room can cause increased problems with positioning and extra damage taken, although if tanks are dying, you can put a DPS or two near the middle to spread out damage from the Tamper Deterrent Devices. Generally it is easier to deal with the Floor Vents with our suggested positioning since the ranged DPS and healers will be out of danger most of the time and can simply shift when necessary.</li>
<li>Like other fights, healers should be doing maximum DPS for the first 45 seconds until the first WOOKIEE RAGE.</li>
</ul>
<h5><span id="Main_Phase">Main Phase</span></h5>
<p>All of the different type of adds will spawn periodically, with Torque jumping to consoles and using WOOKIEE RAGE every 45 seconds. Shortly after the WOOKIEE RAGE cast, have the next person click a console to spawn a repair droid. The best moment for this is while the DPS are killing Shoots Lasers. Ensure any Dangerous Fire Devices in the path of the repair droid are killed promptly. While the repair droid is working, AoE down the opposite side. When the repair droid is finished, AoE that side and prepare for the next WOOKIEE RAGE.</p>
<p>Save CC break for whenever you get Magnetic Clamp and either a Dangerous Fire Device or Floor Vents are on you, or if a healer is unable to cleanse you right away. Otherwise let the healers cleanse you and don’t waste your CC break.</p>
<p>If you are a melee or tank, you need to be extra careful with the Floor Vents. If you have aggro on Torque, note if Floor Vents have spawned recently (in the last 20 seconds). If not, start kiting Torque so that you are moving into a clear area (not next to any raid members or Dangerous Fire Devices) when they spawn. This will allow you to take very few ticks of Floor Vents.<br>
In general, don’t stack too much on other raid members to reduce your chance of having Floor Vents spawn on you. If they do, stop what you’re doing immediately and move into a clear area.</p>
<p>Never try to finish casts while standing in Floor Vents; you should always move immediately. If you’re a healer, more than likely your target will live and you will die if you try to do this. DPS have no excuse whatsoever. Find something you can do on the move instead for a GCD, or simply do nothing, just don’t die. If you’re a melee DPS, these are very annoying to deal with since they obscure your camera, but there’s not much you can do about that. Try to keep panning your camera and move towards clear areas just as Vents spawn. Your tank has the largest responsibility to guide Torque into a safe place to continue DPSing. Feel free to swap onto other targets in the meantime.</p>
<p><strong>Tanks:</strong> Tanks will swap off Torque every single cast of Sick Of You!, in order to avoid taking excess damage. If you are the main tank with Torque, you have several responsibilities.</p>
<p>1) Every time Torque casts WOOKIEE RAGE, he will do a raid-wide knockback and jump to the closest unbroken console and destroy it. You should drag him towards whatever console you want broken next. Controlling this process can allow for better AoE and fewer wasted repair droids.<br>
2) Hold Torque in a good clear location to make life as easy as possible for the other tank and any melee DPS. You should not be trapping the boss in some corner behind Floor Vents.<br>
3) Dangerous Fire Devices spawn next to the boss throughout the fight and will kill repair droids that walk through them. If possible, hold the boss away from the front of the room near where the repair droid spawns, as well as the consoles, especially the two in front. This makes it so that you will have fewer Fire Devices that have to be killed right away.<br>
4) If possible, hold Torque in an optimal location next to several other adds in order to maximize the AoE potential of the DPS.</p>
<p>Note you can take less damage from the boss by kiting, but this will make it more difficult on any melee DPS. Also note that Sick Of You! has a knockback component, so the tank with aggro on Torque just before the tank swap should make sure to get knocked away from any Floor Vents and Dangerous Fire Devices to avoid taking excess damage.</p>
<p>If you are the off tank (not currently holding Torque), you need to watch for the next cast of Sick Of You! and taunt during it to assume primary aggro, as well as help to finish off various adds throughout the room. Your efforts are best spent finishing up adds that are almost dead, typically Tamper Deterrant Devices or Dangerous Fire Devices. This saves the DPS the time it takes to swap back to them. Otherwise, you should remain close to Tamper Deterrent Devices until they are dead in order to hold primary aggro, and put some DPS on Torque.</p>
<p>Also, Tanks can use their taunts on Shoots Lasers to prevent it from killing a repair droid. However, you should ideally try to time repair droid spawn as the raid kills each Shoots Lasers to prevent this from being necessary. Since Dangerous Fire Devices drop next to the boss, try to keep the boss away from the usual path of the repair droid, otherwise your DPS will also have to prioritize killing the Fire Devices.</p>
<p><strong>DPS:</strong> This is one of the most complicated fights for DPS because there are quite a few possible targets, a relatively tight DPS check, and you also have to be careful with any AoE while repair droids are active. In an 8 man raid, your raid leader should assign 2-3 DPS to AoE and handle adds. The other 1-2 DPS should be put on primary boss DPS. If you are a sustained or DoT spec, you should be primarily focusing the boss. Otherwise, your job is to prioritize killing adds and only swapping back to Torque when they are dead. Burst and ranged classes are especially good for adds. Note that Snipers and Sorcerers have the best overall AoE for the Tamper Deterrant Devices.</p>
<p>For DPS not assigned to tunnel Torque, DPS priority is as follows:<br>
1) Shoots Lasers. These target and kill repair droids and deal a fairly substantial amount of damage. Use your high damage burst attacks to eliminate these immediately.<br>
2) Tamper Deterrent Device. These cause a good amount of raid damage and/or add to damage taken by your tanks. AoE these down.<br>
3) Dangerous Fire Device. These are not as crucial as the other adds, but if left up too long, these will enrage and 1-shot anyone who touches them. This is very dangerous for the tanks and melee DPS, especially with the knockback from WOOKIEE RAGE. The only exception is when a Fire Device spawns for any reason in front of a console that needs to be repaired soon. In this case, all DPS should kill it as soon as possible so that the repair droid does not die.<br>
4) Torque.</p>
<p>Remember that if you are on adds, it’s your responsibility to finish off your targets and not leave them with a sliver of health. Try to anticipate target swaps so that you don’t waste a high powered attack making a killing blow, but swap back immediately if the add didn’t actually die. In some cases, your healers or tanks will be able to finish off your targets for you, but you should rely upon them to do so. Also, look for opportunities to get splash damage on the boss while AoE adds (but you should single target Shoots Lasers so that it dies as fast as possible). If your tanks do a good job, they should position Torque next to adds that need to die so that this is possible for you.</p>
<p>Despite the repair droids, it should still be very easy to AoE adds. Just watch which side the repair droid goes to when it spawns, and AoE the opposite side. Make sure that you do not have auto target on (adjust Targeting settings in Preferences), otherwise if you finish a cast or GCD as an add dies, even a single target attack could end up hitting the repair droid instead.</p>
<p><strong>Heals:</strong> This fight is fairly easy to heal if your tanks and/or melee DPS do a good job to avoid/mitigate damage. It is exceptionally easy to heal if your raid has Saber Reflect. The most difficult aspect is preparing for each wave of damage that comes with the Floor Vents and Tamper Deterrent Devices. One simple trick is to save your major heals for these moments. For example, have Rejuvenate/Resurgence already proc an instant Wandering Mend/Roaming Mend just before Floor Vents come out. Or, have Supercharged Gas ready so that you can spam Advanced Medical Probe/Healing Scan. You should not be wasting big heals to deal with the small intermittent damage. Focus target the boss and watch for the Sick Of You! cast to understand when the main tank taking damage will be potentially knocked out of your range.</p>
<p>Another difficult aspect is finding good times to help DPS without letting people die. Here’s what you can do. Throw in DPS, especially on Tamper Deterrent Devices (AoE) or Dangerous Fire Devices, once the raid has stabilized after a set of Floor Vents. Make sure to coordinate with your other healer and let them know if you will be putting in substantial extra DPS so that they can use their energy and cooldowns aggressively. Also, look out for adds that have only a little health left and quickly finish them off so that your DPS don’t have to. If your DPS do a very good job at not leaving adds alive, just swap targets to Torque and occasionally throw in a DPS move or two, especially your DoTs. Even two or three GCDs every 30s can make a difference by the end of the fight. If you are a Sorcerer healer you have an unmatched ability to do DPS, so let your other healer do most of the main healing and use your Force Storm (with the corresponding damage buff utility) liberally.</p>
<p>In general, remember that the DPS are very busy so you and the tanks should prioritize being the ones to spawn repair droids. Don’t make your DPS do it unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>To deal with the Magnetic Clamp cleanse, devise a strategy with the other healer. A simple way is to have one healer work from top to bottom on the raid frame, while the other healer does the opposite. Have one healer also prioritize left column, and the other right column, in case there is a tie within a row. If you use a different frame layout, try to work out a good strategy. Also make sure that you have “Show Only Removable Debuffs” activated for this fight so that raid-wide debuffs such as Inspiration/Bloodthirst do not obscure your view of the Magnetic Clamp icon. If you are a Sorcerer healer, this is inconvenient because the Deionized debuff from your Force Armor/Static Barrier can no longer be seen, but generally it’s better to try to cope with that than miss the Magnetic Clamp since the associated DoT is very damaging. You should definitely not be having raid members call out their Magnetic Clamp over voice comms since other communications are essential in this fight.</p>
<h4><span id="Class-Specific_Tips">Class-Specific Tips</span></h4>
<div style="background: #c54869; width: 100%; height: 2px;"></div>
<p><strong>Guardian/Juggernaut</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Saber Reflect (especially with associated utilities) is excellent in this fight to prevent all damage from most of the Tamper Deterrent Devices. Instruct the raid to move far to one side while you stand alone in the center for maximum effect. Reflect alone will not destroy the adds, but it will make it very easy for the rest of the raid to finish them off.</li>
<li>An excellent use of Saber Ward is to use it while stepping into the middle of the room on either side, closest to the Tamper Deterrent Devices when they spawn. This will deflect a good amount of damage from the tanks and/or the rest of the raid. Do this once your Saber Reflect wears off.</li>
<li>You can use Guardian Leap/Intercede to quickly reposition across the room if you need to click the console to spawn a repair droid.</li>
<li>You have a very good ability to off taunt the boss during the Sick Of You! cast should the need arise. If one or both tanks are dead, pop a defensive cooldown and take over this responsibility. Kite the boss as long as necessary for either a tank to get rezzed or to kill the boss.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sentinel/Marauder</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Guarded by the Force/Undying Rage is good in an emergency to prevent death while repositioning from Floor Vents and/or Fire Devices.</li>
<li>In some cases, it is very dangerous to leap back to the boss because you may leap into fire or another AoE. In these cases, Force Camouflage is a very good gap closer since it will reduce your damage taken as you try to get back into melee range of the boss, and does not have the dangerous uncontrollable side effects of Leap.</li>
<li>An excellent use of Saber Ward is to use it while stepping into the middle of the room on either side, closest to the Tamper Deterrent Devices when they spawn. This will deflect a good amount of damage from the tanks and/or the rest of the raid. Don’t do this if someone is trying to Saber Reflect them.</li>
<li>There is very little use for Predation in this fight due to the small arena, with the possible exception if the tanks die and a DPS must kite the boss to avoid damage, or if the boss has enraged and everyone must try to keep moving.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sage/Sorcerer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you are a DPS Sage/Sorcerer, and you have no Sage/Sorcerer healer, you should may want to use your Force Armor/Static Barrier to protect the tanks and/or melee DPS just prior to Floor Vents. If you are struggling with the DPS check, don’t worry about doing this, or at least only do it when someone is very close to death rather than as a general preventative measure.</li>
<li>The Masterful utility that grants 25% damage reduction from Cloud Mind, combined with a Force Armor/Static Barrier, is excellent for almost all situations in this fight. In particular the 45s cooldown on Cloud Mind lines up very nicely with the 30-45s timers on several boss abilities.</li>
<li>If you are very close to killing the boss and you’ve hit enrage, put up all your DoTs and Force Barrier at the last second before death.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Shadow/Assassin</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Resilience/Force Shroud can be used to resist all damage from Floor Vents, Tamper Deterrent Devices, and Dangerous Fire Devices.</li>
<li>An excellent use of Deflection is to use it while stepping into the middle of the room on either side, closest to the Tamper Deterrent Devices when they spawn. This will deflect a good amount of damage from the tanks and/or the rest of the raid. Don’t do this if someone is trying to Saber Reflect them.</li>
<li>You have a very good ability to off taunt the boss during the Sick Of You! cast should the need arise. If one or both tanks are dead, pop a defensive cooldown and take over this responsibility. Kite the boss as long as necessary for either a tank to get rezzed or to kill the boss.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Gunslinger/Sniper</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Hightail It/Covered Escape can be used when Floor Vents activate to resist some damage and reposition.</li>
<li>Scrambling Field/Ballistic Shield can be used once early during the first or second set of Tamper Deterrent Devices to mitigate raidwide damage, and then again at the end of the fight to help the healers have more time to DPS the boss, or mitigate extra damage around the time of the enrage.</li>
<li>Use Hunker Down/Entrench for each Wookiee Rage cast to avoid the knockback and damage.</li>
<li>Defense Screen/Shield Probe should be used shortly before each round of Floor Vents to mitigate incoming spike damage.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scoundrel/Operative</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Scamper/Exfiltrate will evade all incoming damage for 1.5 seconds and can be used to avoid all damage from Floor Vents and other sources in a pinch.</li>
<li>30% stronger Defense Screen/Shield Probe with reduced cooldown is the best use of Heroic utilities since the damage taken comes in relatively frequent bursts.</li>
<li>Defense Screen/Shield Probe should be used shortly before each round of Floor Vents to mitigate incoming spike damage.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Vanguard/Powertech</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An excellent use of Reactive Shield/Energy Shield is to use it while stepping into the middle of the room on either side, closest to the Tamper Deterrent Devices when they spawn. This will deflect a good amount of damage from the tanks and/or the rest of the raid. Don’t do this if someone is trying to Saber Reflect them.</li>
<li>Use Hold the Line/Hydraulic Overrides during the Wookiee Rage cast to avoid the knockback and damage. You do not need any of the bonuses from your utility tree.</li>
<li>Adrenaline Rush/Kolto Overload is very good to stay alive if you’re hit with ticks of fire from Floor Vents and are taking damage at the same time from other sources like Shoot Lasers or Tamper Deterrent Devices. This will help keep you alive while you reposition or receive heals.</li>
<li>You have a very good ability to off taunt the boss during the Sick Of You! cast should the need arise. If one or both tanks are dead, pop a defensive cooldown and take over this responsibility. Kite the boss as long as necessary for either a tank to get rezzed or to kill the boss.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Commando/Mercenary</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An excellent use of Reactive Shield/Energy Shield is to use it while stepping into the middle of the room on either side, closest to the Tamper Deterrent Devices when they spawn. This will deflect a good amount of damage from the tanks and/or the rest of the raid. Don’t do this if someone is trying to Saber Reflect them.</li>

<li>Since most attacks consist of AOE damage, the Heroic utility to take 30% less AOE damage is worthwhile for this fight.</li>
